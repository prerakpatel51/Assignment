    "1. **Modular Design**: Organized into helper classes (IO, Board, Img, Overlay, Cam, Render, Calib)\n",
    "2. **Interactive UI**: Gradio interface for easy use\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Visualization**: \n",
    "   - 3D camera pose plots\n",
    "   - Sample images with coordinate axes\n",
    "   - Undistortion comparison\n",
    "4. **File I/O**: Saves calibration results to JSON format\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Robust processing with status updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Steps:**\n",
    "1. Print the OpenCV chessboard pattern\n",
    "2. Capture 15-20 calibration images\n",
    "3. Upload images through the interface\n",
    "4. Set pattern parameters (default: 9x6 inner corners, 25mm squares)\n",
    "5. Process images to detect chessboard corners\n",
    "6. Run calibration to compute camera parameters\n",
    "7. View results and visualizations\n",
